<h4> notes</h4>
<p>
replaced feudalism, when the capitalism started expanding → liberalism is thus immensly connected with capitalism and even couldnt be separated from each other<br>
before 19th century: political doctrine that attacked predecessor regimes such as Absolutims and Feudalism, and instead promoted constitutionalism and later parliamentarism. <br>
early 19th century: influenced heavily by hard core capitalist laissez Faire economic policy. The goverment for new middle-class citizens was percieved as a thief that was stealing their hard made money via taxes. Philosophy of this class was based thus only on individual matters. So many liberalist supporters because of economic circumstances activly protested against goverment power and their redistributing policies.So libertanism (strongly believe of individuality) became influential in politics. <br>
In the end of 19 century → rising inequality and worsening of living conditions were stimulus for new ( modern) wing of liberals, the so called social. Their policy goals are higher taxes and equal services for everyone. They became highly influential during and after Great Depression.
